Welcome to our README.

Written Reflection:

1. We began by reading through the objectives, and created an outline for the major things we hoped to accomplish in plain in text. Taking some extra time, we rubber ducked through the project, which helped us think of potential methods we may need to call upon. Once we had our outline, we began to fill it out piece by piece, listening to each others input and finding ways to put it to practice. 

2. As of now, we both thought it would be interesting to make a bigger board and different ship options. We discussed how it would've been possible, essentially offering two different versions of the board and also the ships to place. 

3. We did a lot of driver/navigator. That was our main method. It was really great that we both managed to make times that worked, so we were able to meet for the whole thing.

4. Jacob: Patrick was very supportive of all my ideas, including the silly ones. Whenever I had the seed of an idea, he would let me kind of ramble, and help me make sense of it. I'd say most of those ideas actually ended up seeing the light of day in this project, and it wouldn't have been possible without him.

Presentation Points:

- coordinate input repeat

- ship contained the methods needed for checking the qualities of the base piece
- cell offered the housing for the ship and the unit for the board to be crafted from
- board designed the space and the validation interactions between ship and cell
- game brought it all together, and helped the program run

- For the player inputs, it would be nice if we could figure out how to make it more forgiving in the ordering of the cells
- cleaning up certain methods, valid placement for example

- Patrick and I worked well together. We both made time around each others schedules, and enjoyed the process. I felt heard, and hope he did as well. We rocked the project (hopefully).
